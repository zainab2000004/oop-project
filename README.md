Voting System in OOP Java
📌 Overview

This project is a Voting System implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It allows users to register as voters, cast their votes for candidates, and displays the election results at the end.

The system demonstrates the use of classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in Java.

🎮 Features

Voter Registration – Only registered voters can vote.

Candidate Management – Add, list, and display candidates.

Voting Process – Each voter can cast only one vote.

Result Calculation – Counts votes and declares the winner.

Input Validation – Prevents duplicate voting and invalid entries.

🛠️ OOP Concepts Used

Class & Objects – Separate classes for Voter, Candidate, and VotingSystem.

Encapsulation – Data members kept private with getters/setters.

Inheritance – Common properties/methods (if extended).

Polymorphism – Method overriding for displaying information.
